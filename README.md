# follow_my_eye
Eye movement based cursor movement  (In progress)     
Convolutional neural network based program that 'watches' the eye.    
Flow: Detection of eye -> direct prediction of which pixel the person is focusing on.    
I'm continuously working to try all the possible methods by which this can be achieved. Feel free to contribute to this project.
